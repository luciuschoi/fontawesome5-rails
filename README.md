```

And, out of box, you can use some useful helper methods as follows:

  - fa_icon(shape, options = {}) or far_icon(shape, options = {})
    ```erb
    <%= fa_icon 'address-book' %>
    <%= fa_icon 'address-book', text: 'Address Book' %>
    <%= fa_icon 'address-book', text: 'Address Bookconfirm', icon_size: '2x' %>
    <%= far_icon 'address-book' %>
    <%= far_icon 'address-book', text: 'Address Book' %>
    <%= far_icon 'address-book', text: 'Address Bookconfirm', icon_size: '2x' %>
    ```
  - fas_icon(shape, options = {})
    ```erb
    <%= fas_icon 'address-book' %>
    <%= fas_icon 'address-book', text: 'Address Book' %>
    <%= fas_icon 'address-book', text: 'Address Book', icon_size: '2x' %>
    ```
  - fab_icon(shape, options = {})
    ```erb
    <%= fab_icon 'apple' %>
    <%= fab_icon 'apple', text: 'Apple' %>
    <%= fab_icon 'apple', text: 'Apple', icon_size: '2x' %>
    ```
  - fa_icon_text(shape, text = '', options = {}) or far_icon_text(shape, text = '', options = {})
    ```erb
    <%= fa_icon_text 'address-book', 'Address Book' %>
    <%= fa_icon_text 'address-book', 'Address Book', icon_size: '2x' %>
    <%= far_icon_text 'address-book', 'Address Book' %>
    <%= far_icon_text 'address-book', 'Address Book', icon_size: '2x' %>
    ```
  - fas_icon_text(shape, text = '', options = {})
